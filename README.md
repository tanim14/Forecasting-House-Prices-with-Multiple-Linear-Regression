A Project on Forecasting House Prices with Multiple Linear Regression: An Analysis on OpenML House_Prices Dataset
# Abstract
The present study uses the OpenMLhouse_prices dataset to investigate the relationship between various housing features and their corresponding sale prices in the city of Ames, Iowa. Multiple linear regression was used to model this relationship, with sale price as the dependent variable and 47 housing features as the independent variables. The results of the analysis show that the model is statistically significant, and that it explains a large proportion of the variation in the sale prices (R2 = 0.9999999). Among the independent variables, the most important predictors of sale price were overall quality, total living area, garage area, and the number of full bathrooms. These findings provide valuable insights into the housing market of Ames, Iowa, and can help inform real estate agents, home buyers, and sellers about the factors that affect housing prices in the area.
